* Brand:
Each Brand represents several channels with the brand's name.
Each channel represents the actual platform channel like Youtube, TikTok, Facebook, etc.

Each brand contains:
1. Metadata (ChannelId, ChannelName, Platforms List (sub json), Url for each channel (separated for youtube, TikTok, etc).
2. Posts directory which will be written by the MediaCreator and saved to a known location in that directory, and will be read by the Publisher for posting process (triggered by the Scheduler).
3. Posts_Archive directory which will be written by the publisher (to move a post from Posts to Posts_Archive after posting it successfully).
4. Audit for BLL Audit Trail.

* Scheduler:
There will be only one scheduler instance that will manage the queues for all the brands.
The brand queue will be general for all the channels those it represents.
Each queue item will contain the post id, post name, platforms list (bool for each supported platform).
The scheduler contains each channel's data:
1. Brand, Posts Queue, Queue Metadata (to specify the scheduling logic (FIFO, LIFO, etc), scheduling times (every day at X, on days A, B, C at time X, weekly etc.).

* PublishManager:
Upon a call from the Scheduler, the publisher will get the relevant parameters including which platform to upload to, and will call for the relevant publisher for this task.

* Publisher:
There will be a different publisher for each platform (with a different logic).
For example:
YoutubePublisher.Post(Id ChannelId, String PostPath, String PostMetadata);
TiktokPublisher.Post(Id ChannelId, String PostPath, String PostMetadata);

The publisher will call it's SetAccount (SwitchAccount) method before posting.
