ðŸ§© Overall Architecture Design:
The script is organized into five modular components, each with a dedicated responsibility:

config.py
Stores global constants and configuration variables such as:

Video dimensions, font settings, color presets

Paths for input/output directories

Frame rate and default audio track path

bpm_detector.py
Handles BPM detection using the provided audio file:

Returns both the estimated tempo (BPM) and a list of beat timestamps

Enables precise timing alignment between the music rhythm and text animations

effects_config.py
Centralized configuration for all supported text effects:

Defines animation durations, initial scaling, rotation angles, overshoot values

Contains a SPECIAL_BEAT_SKIP_VALUES map that declares how many beats each effect "skips" to simulate pauses or transitions

Supports easy customization and scalability of effect parameters

typographic_effects.py
Implements visual effects logic for individual tokens:

Includes side-slide, pop-in, rotation, and any future effects

Accepts MoviePy text clips and applies transformations using position, rotation, resizing, or fade transitions

get_content.py
Reserved for future GPT integration:

Will dynamically generate text to match available beats

Must support a target word count that adapts to available beat count minus the number of special character skips

Will allow the entire script to be run in one command without manual input
