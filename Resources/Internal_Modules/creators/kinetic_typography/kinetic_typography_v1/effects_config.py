# SPECIAL_BEAT_SKIP_VALUES: Defines how many beat intervals to skip when a special character is encountered.
# Keys correspond to special characters:
#   '.'  -> Adds 2 skip beats (pause effect).
#   '&'  -> Adds 1 skip beat and triggers a pop-in animation.
#   '!'  -> Adds 1 skip beat and triggers a side-slide animation.
#   '^'  -> Adds 1 skip beat and triggers a rotation animation.
